## How I Made My Effort Estimates  

I made my effort estimates based on prior experience from ICS 314 Workouts of the Day (WODs) and earlier course projects. Since WODs are short, time-boxed exercises focused on specific technical skills, they provided a useful baseline when estimating similar tasks in the project. For each issue, I compared the work to tasks I had done before and adjusted my estimate depending on how familiar I was with the tools, features, and level of integration required.

For example, when estimating a backend feature that involved data handling and application logic, I estimated it would take around three to four hours because it was similar to previous assignments. While the estimate was reasonable based on experience, it did not fully capture the total effort required.

## Did Estimating in Advance Provide Any Benefit?  

Even though my estimates were often off, estimating in advance was still beneficial. Creating an estimate forced me to think through the task before starting and break it into smaller steps such as design, implementation, testing, and debugging. This made it easier to begin work and prevented tasks from feeling overwhelming.

In one case, outlining the steps ahead of time helped me realize that a feature required more setup and validation than expected. Although the estimate was inaccurate, the planning process helped me manage my time more intentionally and maintain steady progress.

## Was Tracking Actual Effort Useful?  

Tracking actual effort was useful because it made clear why my estimates were consistently optimistic. A significant portion of my time was spent on non-coding activities such as researching documentation, thinking through design decisions, and debugging unexpected issues. These tasks are easy to overlook when estimating but often have a large impact on how long work actually takes.

Seeing this pattern across multiple issues helped inform later estimates by reminding me to account for planning and debugging time instead of assuming most effort would be spent writing code.

## How I Tracked My Actual Effort  

I tracked both coding and non-coding effort manually using a Google Sheets log. For each work session, I recorded start and stop times and noted whether the time was spent coding or on non-coding tasks such as planning, research, or debugging. I made sure to pause tracking during breaks or distractions so that only focused work time was counted.

While this method is not perfectly precise, I believe it was reasonably accurate because it required active awareness of how my time was being spent and avoided counting inactive time.

## Reflection: What I Would Change Next Time  

If I were to change my estimation or tracking process in the future, I would explicitly estimate non-coding effort instead of treating it as overhead. Breaking estimates into categories such as research, design, implementation, and debugging would lead to more realistic expectations and better planning.

This change would also make tracking easier and reduce frustration when tasks take longer than expected for reasons that are a normal part of software development.
