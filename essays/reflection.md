## Reflecting on Software Engineering

As I come to the end of ICS 314, I realize that this course was not simply about learning how to build web applications. While I gained hands-on experience using modern web technologies and frameworks, the more important takeaway was learning what software engineering actually means as a discipline. Software engineering is not just writing code that works, but designing systems, managing change, collaborating with others, and making thoughtful decisions that affect users and society. This course helped me understand how professional software is built and maintained, regardless of the type of application.

Before taking this class, I often viewed programming as an individual activity focused mainly on solving isolated problems. ICS 314 shifted that mindset by introducing practices that emphasize structure, teamwork, and long-term thinking. Concepts such as Agile Project Management, configuration management, and ethics in software engineering showed me that software development is as much about process and responsibility as it is about technical skill. These ideas apply far beyond web development and will be useful in almost any technical or collaborative project.

## Agile Project Management Beyond Web Applications

One of the most impactful concepts I learned was Agile Project Management. Agile is an approach to managing projects that emphasizes flexibility, incremental progress, and continuous feedback. Instead of planning every detail upfront, Agile teams work in small cycles, regularly reassessing goals and adapting to changes. This makes projects more resilient to uncertainty and shifting requirements.

In ICS 314, we practiced a specific Agile method called Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM). IDPM organizes work around clearly defined issues, each with specific acceptance criteria. This approach helped my team break down large goals into manageable tasks, track progress transparently, and stay accountable. While we used IDPM for a web application project, I can easily see myself applying it to other contexts, such as mobile app development, backend systems, or even non-software projects like organizing events or managing group research. The core principles of iterative progress and clear task ownership are useful in any complex project.

## Configuration Management and Managing Change

Another major lesson from this course was configuration management. Configuration management refers to the process of systematically tracking, controlling, and documenting changes to a project over time. This includes managing source code, documentation, dependencies, and configuration files so that a system can be reliably maintained and reproduced.

Before this class, I thought tools like GitHub were mainly for saving work or sharing code. ICS 314 showed me that version control systems are essential for collaboration, accountability, and stability. Using commits, branches, pull requests, and issue tracking helped ensure that changes were intentional and traceable. These practices are critical in any software environment, whether working on embedded systems, data analysis pipelines, or open-source projects. Even outside of programming, the idea of carefully tracking revisions and decisions can improve organization and reduce errors.

## Ethics in Software Engineering

ICS 314 also emphasized the importance of ethics in software engineering. Ethics in this context refers to the responsibility engineers have to consider how their software affects users, communities, and society as a whole. Software decisions can impact privacy, accessibility, security, and fairness, making ethical awareness essential.

This course made it clear that software engineers are accountable not only for whether their code works, but also for how it is used and who it affects. Thinking about ethical implications is important in any domain, whether developing healthcare systems, financial software, or social platforms. This perspective reinforced that being a software engineer involves professional responsibility, not just technical ability.

## Conclusion

Overall, ICS 314 taught me that software engineering is about much more than building web applications. I learned how to manage projects effectively, control and document change, and think critically about the broader impact of technology. These lessons apply across many types of software and even beyond technical fields.

Most importantly, this course helped me begin to think like a software engineer. I now better understand the importance of structure, collaboration, and responsibility in building reliable systems. ICS 314 gave me tools and perspectives that I will carry forward into future courses, internships, and professional work, regardless of the technologies I use.
