## I. Introduction

Artificial intelligence has become an increasingly visible part of higher education, particularly in technical fields such as software engineering. In courses like ICS 314, where students move rapidly between conceptual learning, hands-on coding, writing, and collaboration, AI tools can function as academic support rather than shortcuts. Throughout the semester, I primarily used ChatGPT, with limited exposure to tools like GitHub Copilot, as a tutor, debugger, and explanation tool. Rather than relying on AI to produce finished work, I used it to help clarify concepts, understand errors, and reflect on my own learning process. Overall, AI played a supportive role in helping me engage more effectively with the material in ICS 314.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

Throughout ICS 314, my use of AI was intentional and depended on the learning goal of each activity rather than being applied uniformly. For WODs, including experience WODs, practice WODs, and in-class WODs, I generally avoided using AI during timed work. I wanted these exercises to reflect my own understanding and ability to work under pressure, similar to real technical interviews or on-the-job situations. However, I sometimes used AI beforehand to clarify instructions or refresh my understanding of a concept so that I could approach the task with more confidence. In practice settings, AI occasionally helped me sanity-check my approach, but discussion with classmates or the instructor was often more helpful in those moments.

For written work such as essays, AI served as a brainstorming and editing assistant rather than a content generator. I used it to help organize ideas, identify themes, and improve clarity after I had written my own draft. This helped improve readability and flow while keeping the work authentically mine. AI was also useful when learning new concepts or working through tutorials, especially when documentation felt overwhelming. Being able to ask follow-up questions and receive explanations at different levels made it easier to build understanding gradually instead of feeling stuck.

The final project was where AI was most useful overall. Working with unfamiliar tools such as Next.js, Prisma, Semantic UI React, and Playwright led to configuration errors, linting issues, and vague runtime problems. AI helped me narrow down likely causes and better understand error messages, although it was not always correct and often required verification through official documentation. I also used AI to help explain unfamiliar code, improve documentation comments, and think through quality assurance issues such as failing tests or ESLint rules. Outside of coding, AI helped me form clearer questions, write better GitHub issues, and reflect on effort estimation and team workflow.

Overall, AI acted as a support tool rather than a solution engine. It was most helpful for clarification, explanation, and efficiency, but the actual learning still came from writing, debugging, and reasoning through problems on my own.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using AI throughout the course positively influenced my learning experience by making difficult concepts more approachable and reducing frustration when I became stuck. Instead of spending excessive time blocked by a single error or misunderstanding, I could quickly gain clarity and continue making progress. At the same time, ICS 314 emphasized the importance of not over-relying on AI. The structure of WODs, assignments, and the final project ensured that I still developed core problem-solving and coding skills. AI enhanced my understanding, but it did not replace the need to think critically and work through challenges independently.

## IV. Practical Applications Beyond ICS 314

Beyond ICS 314, I have used AI in other courses, internships, and personal projects. In these contexts, AI has helped with debugging, understanding unfamiliar technologies, and improving professional communication. These experiences reinforced the idea that AI is most effective when used as a support tool rather than a substitute for foundational knowledge. Seeing how similar tools are used in real-world environments made the skills I developed in ICS 314 feel more relevant and transferable.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

One challenge of using AI is that its responses often appear correct at first glance but may fail edge cases or ignore project-specific constraints. This became clear during assignments where AI-generated code needed to be tested and refined. These moments highlighted the importance of not trusting AI blindly and of validating suggestions through testing and documentation. At the same time, AI presents opportunities to improve learning efficiency, encourage curiosity, and help students ask better questions. When used responsibly, AI can complement traditional instruction rather than undermine it.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Compared to traditional teaching methods alone, AI-enhanced learning offers faster feedback and alternative explanations when concepts are unclear. Traditional methods such as lectures, WODs, and documentation help build discipline, attention to detail, and independent problem-solving skills. AI adds flexibility and accessibility by providing immediate support. Together, these approaches create a balanced learning environment that supports both understanding and skill development.

## VII. Future Considerations

Looking ahead, AI will likely play an even larger role in software engineering education through deeper integration with IDEs, testing frameworks, and learning platforms. The main challenge will be ensuring that students continue to develop strong fundamentals and do not become overly dependent on AI tools. Courses like ICS 314 already demonstrate a healthy balance by encouraging responsible AI use while prioritizing hands-on learning and critical thinking.

## VIII. Conclusion

Reflecting on my experience, AI played a meaningful but supportive role in ICS 314. It helped me learn more efficiently, debug more effectively, and communicate more clearly, while the course structure ensured that I still developed genuine software engineering skills. When used thoughtfully, AI can enhance learning without replacing the effort required to truly understand and apply software engineering principles. I believe continued, responsible integration of AI will strengthen future software engineering education.
