## Overview

Many UH Mānoa students and faculty care deeply about animals but are unable to own pets due to housing restrictions, limited space, or demanding academic and work schedules. At the same time, local pet owners living near campus often need occasional help with walking, sitting, or short-term care. Currently, most people rely on informal personal arrangements or external apps that lack verification, which can lead to uncertainty around reliability, safety, and accountability. Both pet owners and potential caregivers could benefit from a system designed specifically for the UH community—one centered on trust, transparency, and shared care.

**PawPal UHM** is intended to bridge this gap by connecting pet owners with verified UH students and faculty who are interested in offering walking or sitting services. The platform uses UH-based verification to help ensure that all users belong to the campus community. Owners can list details about their pets, while walkers and sitters can provide information regarding their experience, availability, and comfort level. The goal is to create a safe, campus-centered network where both people and animals benefit from structured support and meaningful interaction.

## Approach

To use PawPal UHM, individuals create an account and select their role as a *Pet Owner*, *Walker/Sitter*, or both. Pet owners can build detailed profiles for each animal, including breed, size, temperament, medical needs, and preferred walking style. Walkers and sitters create profiles highlighting their prior experience with animals, availability, relevant skills, and whether they are volunteering or offering paid services.

The platform suggests matches based on compatibility—such as proximity, experience, and the pet’s personality and needs. For example, if a pet is anxious or reactive, the system prioritizes walkers who have indicated experience handling similar animals. First meetings are encouraged to take place in public, well-lit areas on or near campus, such as the Campus Center lawn or along the Mānoa Stream path, to ensure safety and comfort.

Once a booking is confirmed, owners and walkers can communicate through in-app messaging and complete a short care checklist to clarify expectations. After each session, walkers provide a brief report, and owners submit feedback and ratings. An administrative oversight system helps address any issues and maintains animal welfare and community accountability.

## Mockup Page Ideas

The interface for PawPal UHM could include the following pages:

- **Landing Page:** Introduces the purpose of the platform and explains how safety and verification work.
- **User Home Page:** Displays actions relevant to the user’s selected role(s).
- **Profile Pages:** Owners can create pet profiles; walkers can build service profiles.
- **Match Feed Page:** Shows recommended pairings based on compatibility.
- **Booking Page:** Allows users to schedule care sessions and leave notes.
- **Session Details Page:** Contains care checklists, emergency contacts, and instructions.
- **Rating and Feedback Page:** Used after the session to maintain accountability and transparency.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Supports user verification and dispute management.

## Use Case Ideas

A pet owner logs into PawPal UHM, creates a profile for their dog, and requests a 30-minute walk in the early evening near campus. The system recommends walkers who have indicated availability during that time and who are comfortable with the dog’s size and personality. The owner chooses a walker, confirms the booking, and meets them at a public location. After the walk, the walker submits a short care report summarizing how the session went, and the owner provides a rating and optional comments.

In another scenario, a new walker sets their availability and receives notifications when a nearby owner requests urgent help. The walker accepts the request, completes the session, and gains experience points and reviews that boost their visibility and credibility on the platform.

## Beyond the Basics

Future developments could include optional certifications or badges for users trained in animal care, GPS-tracked walk logs, recurring scheduling options, and connections to local veterinarians for emergency support. PawPal UHM could also organize campus events such as “Pet Therapy Days” during midterms or finals, providing stress relief while strengthening community bonds.

By creating a system rooted in campus identity and shared responsibility, PawPal UHM supports well-being for both the UH Mānoa community and the animals they care about. The platform encourages trustworthy interactions, responsible pet handling, and meaningful companionship in a way that benefits both owners and volunteers.
