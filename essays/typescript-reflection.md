Before this class, I had mostly worked with Java and some JavaScript, so when we started learning TypeScript I wasn’t really sure what I should expect. At first, it honestly felt like “just JavaScript but stricter where you had to specify every little thing,” but the more I used it, the more I understood why it was so useful. One of the biggest differences is how TypeScript makes you define things clearly, such as the types of variables you are defining or what type a function is supposed to return. At first it just felt like extra work and writing to include with no real purpose, but after writing more than a few lines of code, it really improved the readability of my programs. There was no scenario where I was guessing what something is supposed to be, because it’s right there in the code.

Throughout this module, I definitely learned a lot, especially in regards to the syntax of TypeScript and why it can be so useful. Going through the lengthy TypeScript tutorials felt tedious, but it proved to be very useful for the WOD. A lot of it felt like a review as well, since there are many similarities with JavaScript and having previous programming experience certainly helped with the learning process.

The athletic software engineering side of the class was a whole new experience for me. The practice WODs (Workouts of the Day) were honestly one of the most helpful parts. Essentially, you are given a programming problem that you must complete within a certain time limit, which is typically anywhere from 15 minutes up to an hour, depending on the difficulty. At first, the idea of being timed on coding problems was a little intimidating, as I didn’t know what to expect in terms of difficulty or how confident I was in my abilities. But after completing the practice assignments and the first real in-class WOD, I understood that with the right amount of preparation, I could approach the challenge more comfortably. 

What I liked most was how the practice WODs gave me a chance to mess up and learn without the pressure of it being graded. Every time I repeated a problem, I feIt slightly more confident and comfortable with the syntax and differences that TypeScript has to offer. It really feels like practicing any other thing, like a sport, where simply repeating a task quickly builds on your knowledge and increases comfortability.

No matter how much preparation you do for the WODs, they can definitely still be stressful, especially with the time constraints. Checking the timer while trying to focus and program to the best of your ability isn’t exactly the most helpful. But at the same time, it’s kind of enjoyable once you get into it. There’s a certain satisfaction in finishing a problem faster than the last time you tried it. For me, that mix of challenge and repetition really works as a learning style.

Overall, I feel like I learned two really valuable things from this module. On the technical side, I learned a lot about the syntax and use cases of TypeScript where you can write much more readable code. As for athletic software engineering and the WODs, these gave me a way to train myself to solve problems under pressure. Preparing for and completing the WODs was stressful at times, but also rewarding and I feel that it definitely improves software engineering ability.
