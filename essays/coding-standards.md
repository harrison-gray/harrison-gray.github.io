## Rethinking Coding Standards  

When I first heard the term 'coding standards', I thought it referred to unimportant style rules such as indentation, semicolons, or whether to place a curly brace on the same line or the next one. At the time, I assumed these rules were mostly there to make code look neat, not to make it better. The only thing that really mattered, I thought, was whether the program ran correctly. That perspective changed quickly once I started working with ESLint in VSCode. From the first day, I was bombarded with red and yellow underlines pointing out things I had never really thought about before. ESLint flagged unused variables, told me to switch from `let` to `const`, and highlighted spacing or formatting that was inconsistent. At first, I found this incredibly frustrating. I often thought to myself, “The code works, so why does this matter?” But as I kept fixing the issues, I began to realize that every warning was really pointing me toward writing cleaner, more reliable code. Small adjustments, like consistently using `const`, made my code easier to understand later. Removing unused variables forced me to check whether I was missing part of my logic. Even spacing and punctuation corrections helped my files look professional and easier to read at a glance. What began as a distraction turned into a lesson in discipline.  

## Understanding  

Although my first reaction to ESLint was annoyance, I soon realized that it was teaching me valuable habits. Fixing the warnings slowed me down in the beginning, but eventually I started catching myself before making the same mistakes. Instead of seeing the underlines as nagging, I began to see them as reminders. I found that I was thinking more carefully about how I wrote my code, not just whether it would run. This made me more aware of how I used variables, how I structured functions, and how I could keep files consistent and clear. Even though most of my projects are individual assignments right now, I thought about how messy it would be if a group worked without standards. Coding standards prevent this potential group chaos by setting a standard for everyone to follow.

## A Bigger Role in Software Engineering  

The more I thought about it, the more I saw how coding standards fit into the bigger picture of software engineering. Git and GitHub make it possible to track and manage code changes, but coding standards determine how those changes look and how easy they are to understand. Together, they make development feel more organized and less random. ESLint plays the role of a coach by calling out details I might want to ignore. At first, it is not fun to be corrected constantly, but over time the small corrections build discipline and consistency. I realized that the same principle applied in other areas of my life, like sports, where coaches drilled me on the little things until they became habits. ESLint is doing the same for my programming, making me slow down and pay attention until those habits start to stick. Looking back on this first week, I can say that coding standards have changed the way I think about writing code. They are not just cosmetic guidelines. They improve clarity, reduce errors, and make code more trustworthy for both myself and others. While ESLint can sometimes feel overwhelming, it has already helped me raise the level of my work, and I believe it will continue to shape me into a stronger programmer.
