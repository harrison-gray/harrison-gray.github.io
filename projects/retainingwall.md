The Retaining Wall Design Project was completed as part of an engineering course and focused on applying real-world structural design standards. Using the Caltrans Standard Sheets as reference, I designed a retaining wall that met professional specifications and construction requirements. The project involved interpreting engineering drawings, applying structural design principles, and ensuring compliance with state standards. To produce the final design, I utilized AutoCAD to draft detailed plans, incorporating accurate dimensions, materials, and reinforcement details. This project provided hands-on experience in translating engineering guidelines into a technical design, while also strengthening my proficiency with industry-standard drafting tools.
